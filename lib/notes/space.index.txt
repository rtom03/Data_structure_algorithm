Space Complexity RUles of Thumb

Most primitives (boolean,numbers,undefined,null)are constant space


LOGARITHMS

The logarithm of a number roughly measures 
the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value thats less than or equal

To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big 0 Notation

Big 0 can give us a high level understanding of the time 
or space complexity of an algotithm

doest care about precision, only about general trends (linear,quadratic,constant)

the time or space complexity (as measured by Big 0)
depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
