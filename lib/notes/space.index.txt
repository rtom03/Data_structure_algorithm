Space Complexity RUles of Thumb

Most primitives (boolean,numbers,undefined,null)are constant space


LOGARITHMS

The logarithm of a number roughly measures 
the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value thats less than or equal

To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big 0 Notation

Big 0 can give us a high level understanding of the time 
or space complexity of an algotithm

doest care about precision, only about general trends (linear,quadratic,constant)

the time or space complexity (as measured by Big 0)
depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm


How do you improve in solving problems 

1 Devise a plan for solving problems

2 Master a common problem solving patterns

3 understand the problem: restate the problems in my own words,
what are the inputs that go in the problem,
what are the output that should come from the solution to the problem

4 explore concrete examples

5 break it down 

6 solve/simplify

7 look back and refactor
